# save.me
This repository is a proof of concept implementation of a gps-position sharing app,
which would be used to give emergency responders access to GPS location in natural
disasters and other situations where people need to be saved quickly.

Since this is a proof of concept, much if it is not well fleshed out, nor has
it been made with scalability in mind. More specifically, the database schema
needs to be fleshed out and equipped with some sort of garbage collection
scheme.
